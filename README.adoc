desktop-tools
=============
:compact-option:

'desktop-tools' is a collection of tools to run my desktop that might be useful
to other people as well:

 - 'wmstatus' does literally everything my i3 doesn't but I'd like it to. It
   includes PulseAudio volume management and hand-written NUT and MPD clients,
   all in the name of liberation from GPL-licensed software of course
 - 'brightness' allows me to change the brightness of w/e display device I have
 - 'input-switch' likewise switches the input source of external displays
 - 'fancontrol-ng' is a clone of fancontrol that can handle errors on resume
   from suspend instead of setting fans to maximum speed and quitting;
   in general it doesn't handle everything the original does
 - 'priod' sets process CPU, I/O and OOM killer priorities automatically
   according to configuration
 - 'shellify' is a simple script that sets up a shell for commands like vgdb
   and nmcli that are painfully lacking it
 - 'iexec' runs a program and attempts to restart it cleanly when the
   executable file is replaced on the disk
 - 'gdm-switch-user' tells the running GDM daemon, if any, to show the switch
   user screen
 - 'siprandom' uses the SipHash 2-4 algorithm to produce a stream of
   pseudo-random data; it should be fast enough to saturate most devices
 - 'big-brother' tracks the title of the active window and the idle state of
   the user and writes these events to standard output.

Don't expect them to work under any OS that isn't Linux.

Packages
--------
Regular releases are sporadic.  git master should be stable enough.  You can get
a package with the latest development version from Archlinux's AUR, or from
openSUSE Build Service for the rest of mainstream distributions.  Consult the
list of repositories and their respective links at:

https://build.opensuse.org/project/repositories/home:pjanouch:git

Building
--------
Build dependencies: CMake, pkg-config, liberty (included) +
Runtime dependencies: libpulse, libx11, dbus-1, libgdm (optional)

 $ git clone --recursive https://github.com/pjanouch/desktop-tools.git
 $ mkdir desktop-tools/build
 $ cd desktop-tools/build
 $ cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
 $ make

To install the applications, you can do either the usual:

 # make install

Or you can try telling CMake to make a package for you.  For Debian it is:

 $ cpack -G DEB
 # dpkg -i desktop-tools-*.deb
